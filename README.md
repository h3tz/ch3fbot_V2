## Tech
The V2 bots are based on mineflayer and snippets from  [Ch3f_Bot-V1]
Statistics are collected from a [InfluxDB] cloud storage and visualized for the public with [Grafana].

## Bans
Some Players are already banned from service. The bot will automatically ban killers.
So there is always a chance getting banned, be kind to the bots. Contact the developer [in Discord ch3fh3tz#0964] if you feel your ban was not reasonable.
